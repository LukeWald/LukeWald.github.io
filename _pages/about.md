My name is Luke Walden. Iâ€™m a third-year student in the Educational Psychology and Research (EDPR) program at The University of Memphis. During my time as a student, I have served as a Research Assistant to two EDPR professors and as a Teaching Assistant over 3 different courses. My research interests are twofold. Firstly, I am interested in Psychometrics, namely the creation and validation of instruments measuring latent variables. Secondly, I am interested in the intersection of religiosity and personal epistemology of college students. 

If you have any questions regarding me or my work, feel free to reach out.
